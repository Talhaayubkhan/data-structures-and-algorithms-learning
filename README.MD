# 💡 Namaste DSA Foundations

Welcome to my **Namaste DSA Learning Repository** — a journey from the very basics of programming logic to mastering Data Structures & Algorithms 🧩

---

## 🎯 Goal

To build **strong problem-solving and logical thinking skills** by learning DSA from scratch using the **Namaste Dev DSA Course**.

This repo will track my progress, code, notes, and thought process from:

> 👉 Loops → Nested Loops → Patterns → Mathematical Problems → Arrays → Recursion → and beyond 🚀

---

## 📚 Current Focus

**Phase 1 – Programming Foundations**

✅ Topics I’m learning & practicing now:

- 🌀 Understanding Loops (`for`, `while`)
- 🔁 Nested Loops & Pattern Problems
- 🔢 Number Manipulation (e.g. count of digits, second largest)
- 🧠 Building thought process using `%` and `/`
- ✨ Translating logic into clean, readable code
